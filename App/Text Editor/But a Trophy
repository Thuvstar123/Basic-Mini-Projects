I'm happy. I feel joy. I love everything.
The sun shines bright in its soothing sunlight.
Twas' like a sparkling coin, a shilling.
My mind was at peace, no kind of downrights.

I'm not really happy. I didn't really feel joy. I don't really like everything.
I am but a trophy.
An empty cup, where its meaning decays.
Unless truly treasured, its broken and dead, unheard of from time to come.
I am but a trophy.
The pride I had, almost forgotten, or has it.
Unless truly treasured, its alone and there, practically inexisitant.

My gleeful emotions that pain me.
Broken relationships caged in my mind.
My mind feels slow.
It feels lost.
Beautiful sunshines that are unable to pierce through this blinded, dreaded, misty eye.
Who am I?
And if there's a future me.
Who am I?
